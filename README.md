Add what you plan on doing to the Detailed task-list

If making a new screen set Mouse.screen in the init() to that screen and add the behaviour you want to the mouse class
When exiting a screen please use "kbd.key_up(next)" to stop that screen auto exiting when opened again.
masterframe is an interface for simplegui.create_frame() if it doesn't contain an option you need add it, if you are struggling ask someone, Toby kinda understands how to do this, not sure who else does.
