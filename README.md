Read Me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <--(not passive aggressive exclamation marks just reading this may save you some time)
If making a new screen set Mouse.screen in the init() to that screen and add the behaviour you want to the mouse class
When exiting a screen please use "kbd.key_up(next)" to stop that screen auto exiting when opened again.
masterframe is an interface for simplegui.create_frame() if it doesn't contain an option you need add it, if you are struggling ask someone, Toby kinda understands how to do this, not sure who else does.
Ideally use quit(0) to exit the game as quit(1) implies there is an error.
