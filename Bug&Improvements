Improvements/ things we can add:
    -AI - Toby will try this
    -Scalable resolution - not happening, too much tied to static canvas resolution
    -Pixlate sprites to lower loading times 
        - uhhh what
            -By lowering the resolution of images in the game and upscaling we can lower loading time(I think)
            
Bugs:
    -Can't press the same menu button twice
        -instructions then exit instructions then enter instructions again doesn't work
            -this is because the keyboard stores that it read next and instantly exits, to prove this try addin a print to the instructions init
                -fixed with kbd.keyup

Possible Useless code:
    -Master.mostOfIt: Is most of it just to so you don't need to import things? -t

Currently working on:
    Sprite select
    Ways to make the background not kill the game
    Instructions
    Game flow (using the master class)
